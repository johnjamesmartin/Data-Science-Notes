## 24. K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm (k-NN)

K-nearest neighbours algorithm is a method used to classify new data points based on "distance" to known data. It finds the K nearest neighbours, based on our distance metric and lets them all vote on the classification. As an example, we could try to guess the rating of a movie by looking at the 10 movies that are closest to it in terms of genres and popularity.
