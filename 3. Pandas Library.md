## 3. Pandas Library

Pandas is a library of Python functions used by data scientists.

### 3.1. Pandas Overview

- Offers a way to process tabular data, e.g. column & row data within likes of .csv files

- Works well with two other libraries "NumPy" and "Scikit_Learn" in which we might: 1. Load data in Pandas to then manipulate, clean up, etc. 2. Translate this data into a NumPy array 3. Feed the NumPy array in Scikit_Learn

- Upon loading in data using Pandas, a Pandas "data frame" is created and assigned to a variable

### 3.2. Purpose

In the words of the pandas documentation, Python has long been great for data munging (data wraggling) and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. pandas was designed to fill such a gap and enable data scientists to carry out an entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to more domain specific languages like R.

### 3.3. Methods

- Using the method `.head()` on the data frame, we can visualize it (first 5 rows only by default)

- Using `.head(10)` we can visualize a larger data sample. In this case it's 10 rows

- Using `.tail()` we can visualize sample the last rows of our data frame

- Using `.shape` method we get data frame shape/dimensionality, e.g. (13, 7) = 13 rows, 7 columns

- Using `.size` method we get number of cells in data frame, e.g. 91 (13 \* 7)

- Using `.len(df)` function we get number of rows in data frame, e.g. 13

- Using `.columns` method we get data frame column names

- To extract a single column from data frame: `df['someColumn']`

- To extract a single column's value from data frame: `df['someColumn'][0]`

- To extract more than one column from data frame: `df[['someColumn', 'someOtherColumn']]`

- To extract range of column values from data frame: `df[['someColumn', 'someOtherColumn']][:5]`

- To sort a single column from data frame: `df.sort_values(['someColumn'])`

- To perform value counts: `amount = df['someColumn'].value_counts`

- To plot a bar graph/histogram: `amount.plot(kind='bar')`

### 3.4. Pandas Challenge

_Try extracting rows 5-10 of our data frame, preserving only the "Previous Employers" and "Hired" columns. Assign that to a new data frame, and create a histogram plotting the distribution of the previous employers in this subset of the data_:

Solution:

```
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("PastHires.csv")
data = df[['Years Experience', 'Hired']][:5]
data.plot(kind="bar")
```
