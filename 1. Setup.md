## 1. Setup

Let's install the following:

1. Anaconda. This is a Python environment made for scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. It is a distribution system that we can use to easily manage packages in Python and R. Warning: >2GB in size & packages are sometimes memory-heavy, so ensure you have sufficient HDD space.

2. "pydotplus". Package for visualizing decision trees â€” using `conda install pydotplus`.

3. "tensorflow-gpu" (or tensorflow if not Nvidia). Package for building neural networks, AI, and deep learning.
