## 28. Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Bias is how far removed the mean of your predicted values are from the "real" answer. If you take an average of all your predictions and all the errors are skewed in a certain direction then they are "biased".

Variance is how scattered your predicted values are from the "real" answer. A small variance would be tightly-focussed on the "real" answer (imagine lots of points on the bullseye of a target). Ideally you want low bias and small variance. But in reality, we often have to choose between one or another because we don't want to overfit and so a tradeoff between bias and variance is needed.
