## 15. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Before talking about supervised vs. unsupervised learning, it's worth talking about what machine learning is.
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It does this with algorithms that can learn from observational data and make predictions based on it.

### 15.1. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is when a machine learning model is not given any "answers" â€” just a group of data. It is used when we don't know what we are looking for, i.e. latent variables (data you wouldn't have expected).

### 15.2. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is when a machine learning model is given training data with "correct answers" to predict new values. To evaluate supervised learning, we split the model into two groups: 1) train/training set (makes preliminary guesses) and a 2) testing set (correct answers to compare how accurate training set is). In practice train/test sets need to be large enough to account for variation. Train/test is a great way to guard against overfitting.
