## 22. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support vector machines (SVM) are supervised learning models within machine learning in which data is analysed for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, data is clustered into various categories using advanced mathematics — essentially finding higher-dimensional support vectors across which to divide data using something called SVC (support vector classification). Thankfully, the Python package SciKit-Learn provides methods that make this easier for us.

With SVC we can use different "kernals" in which some work better than others given the data set we introduce.

It should be noted that it's a computationally experience process and, under the hood, is only really possible using something called the "kernal trick".

See `SVC.ipynb` for more.
