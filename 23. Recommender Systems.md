## 23. Recommender Systems

Recommender systems are tools used to help predict what usrs might like based on past activities. Two famous examples: Amazon's "People who bought also bought" and Netflix's "Recommended for you" features.

### 23.1. User-based collaborative filtering

User-based collaborative filtering is one kind of recommender system. It works by building a matrix of things users bought/viewed/rated and computers a similarity score between them. In other words, it finds users simimlar to you and recommends stuff they bought/viewed/rated that you haven't yet.

However, there are problems with this type of recommender system. Perhaps the most obvious is that people are fickle and their tastes change. For example, someone might go through a Star Wars phase and then onto romantic comedies leading to recommendations of romantic comedies to someone who likes Star Wars. Another problem is that people do bad things. For example: shilling attacks where accounts are created to try and game the system to recommend certian products to people.

### 23.2. Item-based collaborative filtering

Item-based collaborative filtering allows for a more robust recommender system. Amazon use it for this reason.

Here's why it's superior: items generally always stay the same (unlike people and tastes), there's usually fewer things than people, and it's hard to game.

Item-based collaborative filtering works is implemented in different ways. One way would be:

1. Find every pair of movies watched by same person

2. Measure similarity of ratings across all users who watched both

3. Sort by movie, then by similarity strength

Pivot tables allows us to create a new table from a given data frame, for example: `user_id`, `title`, and `rating`
