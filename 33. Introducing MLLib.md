## 33. Introducing MLLib

Component built on top of Spark for machine learning

### 33.1. Some MLLib Capabilities

- Feature extraction

  - Term frequency / inverse document frequency — useful for search

- Basic statistics

  - Chi-squared test, Pearson or Spearman correlation, min, max, mean, variance

- Linear regression, logistic regression

- Support Vector Machines

- Naive Bayes classifier

- Decision trees

- K-Means clustering

- Principal component analysis, singular value decomposition

- Recommendations using Alternating Least Squares

### 33.2. Special MLLib Data Types

- Vector (dense or sparse). This might be a list of movies a user has watched. A dense vector would include all a user's movie ratings regardless of whether they've rated it or not. A sparse vector would only include a user's movie ratings where movies have been rated — making it much more condensed and memory-intensive than a dense vector.

- LabeledPoint. As the name might suggest, this is a label for a point of data — written in human readable terms.

- Rating. Self-evidently, this is for ratings for recommendation systems
