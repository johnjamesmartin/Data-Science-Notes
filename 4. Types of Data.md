## 4. Types of Data

Recognising types of data is an essential part of data analyses as it helps us build strategies.

### 4.1. Numerical Data

Numerical data has to do with quantative measures, e.g. page load times.

There are two kinds of numerical data:

- Discrete data. This is interger based, e.g. number of purchases made by a customer

- Continuous data. This deals with infinite numbers of values, e.g. times taken (1.003 hours, 0.9992 hours, etc.)

### 4.2. Categorical Data

Qualitative data with no inherent mathematical meaning, e.g. product category, addresses, etc.

### 4.3. Ordinal Data

Mix of numerical and categorical (categories given data), e.g. product rating on a 1-5 scale.

### 4.4. Type of Data Challenge:

Name the type of data:

Q. "How much fuel in tank?". A. Numerical (continuous)

Q. "Rating of health where choices are 1-4 (poor-excellent)". A. Ordinal

Q. "Races of people you know". A. Categorical

Q. "Age in years". A. Numerical (discrete)

Q. "Money spent in store". A. Numerical (continuous)
