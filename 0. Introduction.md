# Machine Learning, Data Science & Deep Learning with Python

Data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are currently the most valuable technical skills you can have (says industry expert Frank Kane).

In these notes I will document my learning journey through these subjects â€” mainly in conjunction with [this course](<[https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/learn/lecture/4020708#overview](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/learn/lecture/4020708#overview)>) on Udemy. I will also record observations made during code tutorials on technologies like "Tensorflow", "neural networks", etc.
