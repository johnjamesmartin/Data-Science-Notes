## 12. Polynomial Regression

Not all relationships are linear or limited to a straight line formula (`y = mx + b`).

Some are more curvy and complex with a power of `x` greater than 1. These are polynomials beyond "first order" or "first degree". We classify polynomials like so:

- "First order"/"first degree" polynomial: a straight line where `x` has a power of 1 (`y = mx + b`)

- "Second order"/"second degree" polynomial: a curve where `x` has a power of 2 `y = ax² + bx + c`

- "Third order"/"third degree" polynomial: a curve where `x` has a power of 3 `y = ax³ + bx² + cx + d`

Higher orders produce more complex curvers, but beware overfitting! Do not use more degrees than you need, visualise data first to see how complex a curve there might be, and visualise the fit to ensure the curve is not going out of its way for outliers. In NumPy, we can use the `polyfit()` method to make the process easier.
