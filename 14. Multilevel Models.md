## 14. Multilevel Models

Multilevel models comprise an advanced topic that is beyond the scope of these learnings, but it is worth being familiar with what it is. Essentially it's a concept that some effects happen at various levels in a hierarchy. For example: your health depends on health of cells, organs, you as a whole, your family, etc. Multi-level models attempt to a model and account for these interdependencies and must identify factors that affect the outcome trying to be predicted at every level.
