## 27. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is when you introduce some sort of angent that "explores" a space. The agent learns the value of different state changes in different conditions. This then informs the agent's behaviour — how it should move in order to optimally achieve a goal.

Reinforcement learning yields fast on-line performance once the space has been explored.

### 27.1. Q-Learning

Q-learning is a specific implementation of reinforcement learning where we have:

1. A set of environmental states `s`

2. A set of possible actions in those states `a`

3. A value of each state/action `Q`

We start off with Q values of 0 and explore the space. When rewards happen we increase the Q value and when bad things happen we decrease the Q value.

### 27.2. The Exploration Problem

A problem in reinforcement learning is how to efficiently explore all of the possible states. A simple approach would be to always choose the action for a given state with the highest Q, and if there's a tie, choose at random. However, this is very inefficient and we might miss a lot of paths this way.

A better way would be introducing an epsilon term, i.e. if a random number if less than epsilon, don't follow the highest Q but choose at random. This way exploration never totally stops. With this being said, choosing epsilon can be tricky.

### 27.3. Markov Decision Process

The solutions to the exploration problem above are more formally known as MDPs (Markov decision processes). This is a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

An MDP is known as a "discrete time stochastic control process".

### 27.4. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of these just once and storing the solution — ideally using a memory-based data structure. The next time the same subproblem occurs, the previously computed solution is looked to. This aims to save on computation time and memory.
