## 37. T-Tests & P-Values

T-tests and P-values let us know if a result is likely to be "real" as opposed to random variation.

### 37.1. The T-Statistic

The T-statistic (also know as a "T test') is a measure of the difference between the two sets expressed in units of standard error. It is the size of the difference relative to the variance in the data with a high t value meaning there's probably a real difference between the two sets

The T-statistic assumes a normal distribution of behaviour. This is a good assumption if you're measuring revenue as conversion. See also: Fisher's exact test (for clickthrough rates), E-test (for transactions per user), and chi-squared test (for product quantities purchase).

### 37.2. The P-Value

Think of the P-value as the probability of `A` and `B` satisfying the "null hypothesis". As such, a low P-value would imply significance.

It is the probability of an observation lying at an extreme t-value assuming the null hypothesis.

### 37.3. Using P-Values

Choose some threshold for "significance" before your experiment. 1% or 5%, perhaps. When the experiment is over, measure the P-value. If it's less than your significance threshold, you can reject the null hypothesis. If it's a positive change, roll it out â€” if it's negative discard (or lose money!).
