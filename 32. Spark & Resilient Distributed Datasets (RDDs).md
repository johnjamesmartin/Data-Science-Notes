## 32. Spark & Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)

Resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) — it sounds complex. Let's break it down:

- "R" = Resilient. It is described this way because of the resilience to complete a task. For example, if a cluster goes down, it will automatically recover and retry (providing the necessary resources are available).

- "D" = Distributed. Because RDDs are often used as a big data solution, there's the ability to distribute operations across the CPU and memory of a large cluster of computers — perhaps horizontally distributed in which case there is no limit or upper bound to how many systems you can add to handle the load.

- "D" = Datasets. RDDs are a type of dataset in that there are rows of information that contain pretty much anything you like.

### 32.1. SparkContext

The SparkContext object (sc) is what all Spark scripts start with. It is created by the driver program/shell.

It is what's responsible for making RDDs resilient and distributed.

### 32.2. Creating RDDs

Here's some ways we can create RDDs:

`nums = patallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])`

`sc.textFile("filepathhere://sometextfile.txt")`

`hiveCtx = HiveContext(sc)`

`rows = hiveCtx.sql("SELECT name, age FROM users")`

Can also create from: JDBC, Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch, JSON, CSV, sequence files, object files, and various compressed formats.

### 32.3. Transforming RDDs

We can transform RDDs by taking rows of data and applying the following (chainable) methods:

- `map`

- `flatmap`

- `filter`

- `distinct`

- `sample`

- `union`, `intersection`, `subtract`, `cartesian`

### 32.4. Map() Example

`rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])`

`rdd.map(lambda x: x * x)`

The above code yields 1, 4, 9, 16.

### 32.5. RDD Actions

A number of action methods can be applied to RDDs:

- `collect`

- `count`

- `countByValue`

- `take`

- `top`

- `reduce`

- ...and more...

### 32.6. Lazy Evaluation

Nothing actually happens in Spark until we call an action. This can trip beginners up who might have a print output function, or something similar, that does not appear because an action hasn't been called.
