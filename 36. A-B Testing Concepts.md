## 36. A/B Testing Concepts

An A/B test is a controlled experiment — usually in the context of a website. You test the performance of some change to your website (the variant) and measure conversation relative to you unchanged site (the control).

### 36.1. Purpose

You can test almost anything with A/B testing, including:

- Design changes

- UI flow

- Algorithmic changes

- Pricing changes

### 36.2. Measuring Conversion

Ideally choose what you are trying to influence:

- Order amounts

- Profit

- Ad clicks

- Order quantity

However, attributing actions downstream from you change can be hard — especially if you're running more than one experiment.

### 36.3. Variance is the Enemy

A common mistake is to run a test for some small period of time that results in a few purchases to analyse. To do this, you might take the mean order amount from A and B and declare victory or defeat. However, there's so much random variation in order amounts to begin with that your result could be based on chance.

This caveat is important to bear in mind because failing for it can be harmful and cost the company a lot of money.
