### 8. Co-variance & Correlation

Ways of measuring whether attributes in a set of data are related to each other

#### 8.1. Co-variance

Co-variance measures how two variables vary in tandem from their means. Convert these to vectors of variances from the mean, take the dot product (cosine of angle between them) of the vectors, and divide by sample size.

Interpreting co-variance is difficult. Small co-variances — values close to 0 — means not much correlation between variables. Large co-variances — values far from 0 (negative for inverse relationships) — means a correlation. However, how large is large?

- -1 means a perfect inverse correlation
- 0 means no correlation
- 1 means perfect correlation

#### 8.2. Correlation vs. Causation

Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. Correlations only really help us decide on what experiments to conduct to determine causes. If you were wanting to find correlation in statistics, you'd need a controlled and randomized experience.
