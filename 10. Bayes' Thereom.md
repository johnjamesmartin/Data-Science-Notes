### 10. Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theoreom is based on conditional probability. It's broadly applicable but used particularly in specific disciplines, e.g. medicine.

### 10.1. Notation

The equation for working out Bayes' theoreom is as follows:

`P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)`

In plain terms this means the probability of `A` given `B` is the probability of `A` times probability of `B` given `A` over the probability of `B`.

### 10.2. Purpose

As mentioned, Bayes' theorem is used a lot in medicine. One instance is drug testing.

### 10.3. Caveats

However, in using Bayes' theorem, there's caveats to bear in mind: even a "highly accurate" result (like a result of a drug test) can produce more false positives that true positives. Let's say we have a drug test that can accurately identify users of a drug 99% of the time and accurately has a negative result for 99% of non-users. But only 0.3% of the overall population uses this drug.

So, take Bayes' theorem findings with a grain of salt. If you apply Bayes' theorem to probabilities, what sounds like a high accuracy rate can actually yield inaccurate results given a low incidence of a given problem. Although this depends a lot on the overall probability of (to continue drug use example above) being a drug user in the population â€” not just the accuracy of the test. Bayes' theorem gives us the tools to quantify this effect.

Also bear in mind that the probability of something given something else is not the same thing as the other way around. This depends a lot on the base probability of the things you're measuring.
