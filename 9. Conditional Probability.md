## 9. Conditional Probability

Conditional probability determines if there's a dependency in data. Think of it in these terms: "if I have two events that depend on each other, what's the probability that both will occur?"

### 9.1. Purpose

There's a number of useful purposes and use cases for conditional probability. A good example of this is Amazon's recommendations feature: "if user bought this movie and liked it, what's the probability that they will also like this one?"

### 9.2. Notation

The notation can be quite tricky:

`P(B|A) = P(A,B)/P(A)`

- This is said as "P of B bar A".

- This bar operator is used given an entire population whereas commas are used given a sample.

- Left of equals (`P(B|A)`) means the probability of `B` given that `A` has occured.

- Right of equals `P(A,B)` is the probability of `A` and `B` both occuring.
